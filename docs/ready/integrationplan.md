### Step-by-Step Integration Plan for Project Planning System

## Phase 1: Preparation and Setup (1-2 weeks)

1. Create a new module directory structure in `modules/planning-system/` following the application's modular architecture
2. Define the module's types in `modules/planning-system/types.ts` based on existing project types
3. Map the current planning system data model to the Supabase database schema
4. Create a Zustand store in `modules/planning-system/store.ts` to manage the planning system state
5. Test the store with mock data to ensure proper state management


## Phase 2: Core Components Migration (2-3 weeks)

6. Create a context provider in `modules/planning-system/context.tsx` to handle shared state
7. Migrate the Roadmap component to `modules/planning-system/components/roadmap/index.tsx`
8. Adapt the header components to use Radix UI and the application's theme
9. Convert section and task components to follow the application's component patterns
10. Implement responsive design using Tailwind CSS classes
11. Test each component individually to ensure proper rendering and functionality


## Phase 3: Data Integration (1-2 weeks)

12. Create data access hooks in `modules/planning-system/hooks/` for fetching and manipulating data
13. Implement Supabase queries for projects, sections, tasks, and loadings
14. Add proper error handling and loading states
15. Create server actions for data mutations (adding/editing loadings, changing responsibilities)
16. Test data fetching and mutations with real database connections


## Phase 4: Module Pages and Navigation (1 week)

17. Create the main module page in `modules/planning-system/PlanningSystemPage.tsx`
18. Implement the sidebar menu component in `modules/planning-system/PlanningSystemMenu.tsx`
19. Add the page to the Next.js App Router in `app/dashboard/planning/page.tsx`
20. Integrate the menu component into the application's sidebar
21. Test navigation and routing to ensure proper integration


## Phase 5: Forms and Interactions (1-2 weeks)

22. Convert the loading form to use react-hook-form with zod validation
23. Implement modal dialogs for adding/editing loadings using the application's Dialog component
24. Create filter components using the application's Popover and Select components
25. Add toast notifications for success/error feedback using Sonner
26. Test all forms and interactions to ensure proper functionality


## Phase 6: Permissions and Access Control (1 week)

27. Define required permissions for the planning system in the permissions table
28. Implement permission checks in UI components and server actions
29. Create role-specific views (manager view vs. department view)
30. Test with different user roles to ensure proper access control


## Phase 7: Theme and Styling (1 week)

31. Ensure all components support both light and dark themes
32. Verify responsive design on different screen sizes
33. Implement consistent styling using the application's design system
34. Test theme switching to ensure proper appearance in both modes


## Phase 8: Testing and Optimization (1-2 weeks)

35. Perform comprehensive testing of all features and interactions
36. Optimize data fetching with proper caching strategies
37. Implement loading states and skeleton loaders for better UX
38. Fix any bugs or issues discovered during testing
39. Conduct performance testing and optimize as needed


## Phase 9: Documentation and Deployment (1 week)

40. Document the module's architecture and usage
41. Create user documentation for the planning system features
42. Prepare the module for deployment with proper environment variables
43. Deploy to staging environment for final testing
44. Deploy to production after successful staging tests


## Key Success Factors

- Test each component and feature incrementally before moving to the next step
- Maintain consistent state management using Zustand
- Follow the application's design patterns and component structure
- Ensure proper error handling and loading states throughout
- Implement proper permissions and access control from the beginning
- Maintain responsive design and theme support across all components


This plan provides a structured approach to integrating the planning system while ensuring each step is tested before proceeding to the next, minimizing integration issues and ensuring a smooth implementation.
